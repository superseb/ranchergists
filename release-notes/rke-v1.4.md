Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you're running.

## What's Changed
- [CI] Publish the sha256sum file for assets in the release
 

# RKE Kubernetes versions

With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you're running.

## What's Changed

Fixed an issue where an RKE provisioned cluster stores the cluster state in a configmap called `full-cluster-state` inside the `kube-system` namespace. This cluster state object contains information used to set up the Kubernetes cluster, which may include sensitive data. For more information, see [CVE-2023-32191](https://github.com/rancher/rke/security/advisories/GHSA-6gr4-52w6-vmqx).

# Release v1.4.5

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you're running.

## Enhancements

- Introduced `v1.25.9-rancher2-1`, `v1.24.13-rancher2-1` and `v1.23.16-rancher2-2`
- ACI-CNI version bumped from `5.2.3.5` to `5.2.3.6`  

## Known Major Issues

- Ephemeral `/var/lib/dockershim` and `/var/lib/cri-dockerd` directories for kubelet container could cause kubelet/dockershim to send empty portMappings after upgrade. The workaround is to bind mount these directories by specifying `extra_binds` for kubelet service. See [#2993](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/2993). 
- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g., hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you're running.

## Enhancements

# Release v1.4.3

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Enhancements

- Introduced `v1.24.10-rancher4-1` and `v1.23.16-rancher2-1`. 

## Major Bug Fixes 
- Fixed high cpu usage issue for v1.24 clusters [#38816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816) 
- Fixed issues around `hostname-override` for AWS cloud provider: 
   1. Added `hostname-override` back to RKE. RKE will continue finding the node by matching `hostname_override` to `kubernetes.io/hostname` label on the node. Fixes `node not found` regression. 
   
   2. RKE will now set the `hostname-override` for `kube-proxy` to the instance metadata hostname only if `useInstanceMetadataHostname` is true. If `useInstanceMetadataHostname` is false, RKE will use `hostname-override` set by users. 
   
   Refer to [RKE PR](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/3140) for more details and https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37634#issuecomment-1404341406 for testing usecases. 

- Fixed upgrade issue from clusters having v1beta1 calico custom resource definitions with latest kubernetes versions. [#40280](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40280)

- Removed flannel cpu/memory limits with latest kubernetes versions [#40178](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40178) 
      
## Known Major Issues

- Ephemeral `/var/lib/dockershim` and `/var/lib/cri-dockerd` directories for kubelet container could cause kubelet/dockershim to send empty portMappings after upgrade. The workaround is to bind mount these directories by specifying `extra_binds` for kubelet service. See [#2993](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/2993).
