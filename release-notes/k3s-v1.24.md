# Release v1.24.11+k3s1
<!-- v1.24.11+k3s1 -->
This release updates Kubernetes to v1.24.11, and fixes a number of issues.

For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#changelog-since-v12410).

## Changes since v1.24.10+k3s1:

* Add jitter to scheduled snapshots and retry harder on conflicts [(#6783)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6783)
  * Scheduled etcd snapshots are now offset by a short random delay of up to several seconds. This should prevent multi-server clusters from executing pathological behavior when attempting to simultaneously update the snapshot list ConfigMap. The snapshot controller will also be more persistent in attempting to update the snapshot list.
* Bump cri-dockerd [(#6799)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6799)
  * The embedded cri-dockerd has been updated to v0.3.1
* Bugfix: do not break cert-manager when pprof is enabled [(#6838)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6838)
* Bump vagrant boxes to fedora37 [(#6859)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6859)
* Fix cronjob example [(#6865)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6865)
* Ensure flag type consistency [(#6868)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6868)
* Wait for cri-dockerd socket [(#6854)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6854)
* Consolidate E2E tests [(#6888)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6888)
* Ignore value conflicts when reencrypting secrets [(#6918)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6918)
* Allow ServiceLB to honor `ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local` [(#6908)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6908)
  * ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members.
* Use default address family when adding kubernetes service address to SAN list [(#6905)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6905)
  * The apiserver advertised address and IP SAN entry are now set correctly on clusters that use IPv6 as the default IP family.
* Fix issue with servicelb startup failure when validating webhooks block creation [(#6920)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6920)
  * The embedded cloud controller manager will no longer attempt to unconditionally re-create its namespace and serviceaccount on startup. This resolves an issue that could cause a deadlocked cluster when fail-closed webhooks are in use.
* Backport user-provided CA cert and `kubeadm` bootstrap token support [(#6930)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6930)
  * K3s now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before K3s starts in the github repo at [contrib/util/certs.sh](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/certs.sh).
  * K3s now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `k3s token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
  * K3s agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
* Fix access to hostNetwork port on NodeIP when egress-selector-mode=agent [(#6937)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6937)
  * Fixed an issue that would cause the apiserver egress proxy to attempt to use the agent tunnel to connect to service endpoints even in agent or disabled mode.
* Update flannel to v0.21.1 [(#6925)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6925)
* Allow for multiple sets of leader-elected controllers [(#6942)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6942)
  * Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
* Fix etcd and ca-cert rotate issues [(#6955)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6955)
* Fix ServiceLB dual-stack ingress IP listing [(#6988)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6988)
  * Resolved an issue with ServiceLB that would cause it to advertise node IPv6 addresses, even if the cluster or service was not enabled for dual-stack operation.
* Bump kine to v0.9.9 [(#6976)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6976)
  * The embedded kine version has been bumped to v0.9.9. Compaction log messages are now omitted at `info` level for increased visibility.
* Update to v1.24.11-k3s1 [(#7009)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7009)

# Release v1.24.9+k3s2
<!-- v1.24.9+k3s2 -->

This release updates containerd to v1.6.14 to resolve an issue where pods would lose their CNI information when containerd was restarted.

## Changes since v1.24.9+k3s1:

* Backport missing E2E test commits [(#6616)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6616)
* Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 [(#6695)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6695)
  * The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for [containerd/7843](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843) which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod.

# Release v1.24.9+k3s1
<!-- v1.24.9+k3s1 -->

> ## ⚠️ WARNING
> This release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever K3s is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this K3s release from the channel server. Please use `v1.24.9+k3s2` instead.

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.24.9, and fixes a number of issues.

**Breaking Change:** K3s no longer includes `swanctl` and `charon` binaries. If you are using the ipsec flannel backend, please ensure that the strongswan `swanctl` and `charon` packages are installed on your node before upgrading K3s to this release.

<!-- v1.24.7+k3s1 -->
This release updates Kubernetes to v1.24.7, and fixes a number of issues.

The K3s [CIS Hardening Guide](https://docs.k3s.io/security/hardening-guide) has been updated to include configuration changes required to support embedding ServiceLB in the cloud controller manager. If you have followed the hardening guide, please update your policies and RBAC in accordingly.

For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#changelog-since-v1246).

## Changes since v1.24.6+k3s1:

* Add flannel-external-ip when there is a k3s node-external-ip [(#6189)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6189)
* Backports for 2022-10 [(#6227)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6227)
  * The embedded metrics-server version has been bumped to v0.6.1
  * The ServiceLB (klipper-lb) service controller is now integrated into the K3s stub cloud controller manager.
  * Events recorded to the cluster by embedded controllers are now properly formatted in the service logs.
  * Fixed an issue with the apiserver network proxy that caused `kubectl exec` to occasionally fail with `error dialing backend: EOF`
  * Fixed an issue with the apiserver network proxy that caused `kubectl exec` and `kubectl logs` to fail when a custom kubelet port was used, and the custom port was blocked by firewall or security group rules.
  * The embedded Traefik version has been bumped to v2.9.1 / chart 12.0.0
* Replace deprecated ioutil package [(#6235)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6235)
* Fix dualStack test [(#6250)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6250)

# Release v1.24.2+k3s2
<!-- v1.24.2+k3s2 -->
This fixes several issues in the v1.24.2+k3s1 and prior releases.

## Changes since v1.24.2+k3s1:

* Bumped kine to fix an issue where namespaced lists that included a field-selector on metadata.name would fail to return results when using a sql storage backend. ([#5795](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5795))
* K3s will no longer log panics after upgrading directly from much older kubernetes releases, or when deploying services with `type: externalname`. ([#5771](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5771))
* Fixed an issue that prevented `kubectl logs` and other functionality that requires a connection to the agent from working correctly when the server's `--bind-address` flag was used, or when k3s is used behind a http proxy. ([#5780](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5780))
* Fixed an issue that prevented newer versions of k3s from joining clusters that do not have egress-selector-mode support. ([#5785](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5785))
* Remove go-powershell dead dependency ([#5777](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5777))

## Known Issues

- [#5823](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/5823) - When using ServiceLB, deleting Services with `type: LoadBalancer` will leave orphan `svclb-` DaemonSets. This will be fixed in a subsequent release.
