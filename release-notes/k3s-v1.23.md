# Release v1.23.17+k3s1
<!-- v1.23.17+k3s1 -->
This release updates Kubernetes to v1.23.17, and fixes a number of issues.

For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v12316).

## Changes since v1.23.16+k3s1:

* Add jitter to scheduled snapshots and retry harder on conflicts [(#6784)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6784)
  * Scheduled etcd snapshots are now offset by a short random delay of up to several seconds. This should prevent multi-server clusters from executing pathological behavior when attempting to simultaneously update the snapshot list ConfigMap. The snapshot controller will also be more persistent in attempting to update the snapshot list.
* Bugfix: do not break cert-manager when pprof is enabled [(#6839)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6839)
* Fix cronjob example [(#6866)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6866)
* Consolidate E2E tests [(#6889)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6889)
* Bump vagrant boxes to fedora37 [(#6910)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6910)
* Ignore value conflicts when reencrypting secrets [(#6917)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6917)
* Use default address family when adding kubernetes service address to SAN list [(#6906)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6906)
  * The apiserver advertised address and IP SAN entry are now set correctly on clusters that use IPv6 as the default IP family.
* Allow ServiceLB to honor `ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local` [(#6909)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6909)
  * ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members.
* Fix issue with servicelb startup failure when validating webhooks block creation [(#6921)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6921)
  * The embedded cloud controller manager will no longer attempt to unconditionally re-create its namespace and serviceaccount on startup. This resolves an issue that could cause a deadlocked cluster when fail-closed webhooks are in use.
* Backport user-provided CA cert and `kubeadm` bootstrap token support [(#6931)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6931)
  * K3s now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before K3s starts in the github repo at [contrib/util/certs.sh](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/certs.sh).
  * K3s now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `k3s token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
  * K3s agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
* Fix access to hostNetwork port on NodeIP when egress-selector-mode=agent [(#6938)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6938)
  * Fixed an issue that would cause the apiserver egress proxy to attempt to use the agent tunnel to connect to service endpoints even in agent or disabled mode.
* Allow for multiple sets of leader-elected controllers [(#6943)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6943)
  * Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
* Fix etcd and ca-cert rotate issues [(#6956)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6956)
* Update flannel to v0.21.1 [(#6964)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6964)
* Fix ServiceLB dual-stack ingress IP listing [(#6989)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6989)
  * Resolved an issue with ServiceLB that would cause it to advertise node IPv6 addresses, even if the cluster or service was not enabled for dual-stack operation.
* Bump kine to v0.9.9 or newer [(#6991)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6991)
  * The embedded kine version has been bumped to v0.9.9. Compaction log messages are now omitted at `info` level for increased visibility.
* Update to v1.23.17-k3s1 [(#7005)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7005)

# Release v1.23.16+k3s1
<!-- v1.23.16+k3s1 -->
This release updates Kubernetes to v1.23.16, and fixes a number of issues.

For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v12315).

## Changes since v1.23.15+k3s1:

* Backport missing E2E test commits [(#6699)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6699)
* Pass through default tls-cipher-suites [(#6732)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6732)
  * The K3s default cipher suites are now explicitly passed in to kube-apiserver, ensuring that all listeners use these values.
* Bump action/download-artifact to v3 [(#6749)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6749)
* Backport dependabot/updatecli updates [(#6763)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6763)
* Fix Drone plugins/docker tag for 32 bit arm [(#6766)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6766)
* Update to v1.23.16+k3s1 [(#6776)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6776)
* Bump containerd to v1.5.16-k3s2 [(#6810)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6810)
  * The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.5.16-k3s2. This includes a backported fix for [containerd/7843](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843) which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod.

# Release v1.23.13+k3s1
<!-- v1.23.13+k3s1 -->
This release updates Kubernetes to v1.23.13, and fixes a number of issues.

The K3s [CIS Hardening Guide](https://docs.k3s.io/security/hardening-guide) has been updated to include configuration changes required to support embedding ServiceLB in the cloud controller manager. If you have followed the hardening guide, please update your policies and RBAC in accordingly.

For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v12312).

## Changes since v1.23.12+k3s1:

* Add flannel-external-ip when there is a k3s node-external-ip [(#6191)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6191)
* Backports for 2022-10 [(#6228)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6228)
  * The embedded metrics-server version has been bumped to v0.6.1
  * The ServiceLB (klipper-lb) service controller is now integrated into the K3s stub cloud controller manager.
  * Events recorded to the cluster by embedded controllers are now properly formatted in the service logs.
  * Fixed an issue with the apiserver network proxy that caused `kubectl exec` to occasionally fail with `error dialing backend: EOF`
  * Fixed an issue with the apiserver network proxy that caused `kubectl exec` and `kubectl logs` to fail when a custom kubelet port was used, and the custom port was blocked by firewall or security group rules.
  * The embedded Traefik version has been bumped to v2.9.1 / chart 12.0.0
* Replace deprecated ioutil package [(#6236)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6236)
* Fix dualStack test [(#6251)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6251)

## Changes since v1.23.9+k3s1:

* Fix secrets reencryption for 8K+ secrets [(#5939)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5939)

# Release v1.23.9+k3s1
<!-- v1.23.9+k3s1 -->
This release updates Kubernetes to v1.23.9, and fixes a number of issues.

For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1238).

## Changes since v1.23.8+k3s2:
* Fixed an issue that would cause etcd restore to fail when restoring a snapshot made with secrets encryption enabled if the --secrets-encryption command was not included in the config file or restore command. [(#5819)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5819)
* Fix deletion of svclb DaemonSet when Service is deleted
* Fixed a regression that caused ServiceLB DaemonSets to remain present after their corresponding Services were deleted.
    Manual cleanup of orphaned `svclb-*` DaemonSets from the `kube-system` namespace may be necessary if any LoadBalancer Services were deleted while running an affected release. [(#5826)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5826)
* Backport runc and remotedialer version bumps
* Updated rancher/remotedialer to address a potential memory leak.
* The embedded runc binary has been bumped to v1.1.3 [(#5827)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5827)
* Address issues with etcd snapshots
* Scheduled etcd snapshots are now compressed when snapshot compression is enabled.
* The default etcd snapshot timeout has been raised to 5 minutes.
    Only one scheduled etcd snapshot will run at a time. If another snapshot would occur while the previous snapshot is still in progress, an error will be logged and the second scheduled snapshot will be skipped.
* S3 objects for etcd snapshots are now labeled with the correct content-type when compression is not enabled. [(#5842)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5842)
* Update to v1.23.9 [(#5871)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5871)

# Release v1.23.8+k3s2
<!-- v1.23.8+k3s2 -->
This fixes several issues in the v1.23.8+k3s1 and prior releases.

## Changes since v1.23.8+k3s1:

* Fixed an issue that prevented `kubectl logs` and other functionality that requires a connection to the agent from working correctly when the server's `--bind-address` flag was used, or when k3s is used behind a http proxy. ([#5797](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5797))
* K3s will no longer log panics after upgrading directly from much older kubernetes releases, or when deploying services with `type: externalname`. ([#5797](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5797))
* Bumped kine to v0.9.3 ([#5797](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5797))
* Fixed an issue that prevented newer versions of k3s from joining clusters that do not have egress-selector-mode support. ([#5791](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5791))

## Known Issues

- [#5823](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/5823) - When using ServiceLB, deleting Services with `type: LoadBalancer` will leave orphan `svclb-` DaemonSets. This will be fixed in a subsequent release.

For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1237).

## Changes since v1.23.7+k3s1:

* Remove kube-ipvs0 interface when cleaning up [(#5680)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5680)
* Add FlannelConfCNI flag [(#5682)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5682)
* Integration and E2E test improvements [(#5686)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5686)

# Release v1.23.4+k3s1
This release updates Kubernetes to v1.23.4, and fixes a number of issues.

For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1233).

## Known Issues: 
* There is [an issue](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4023) that may cause unexpected behavior when removing servers running embedded etcd from the cluster. When removing servers with etcd from the
 cluster, ensure that the k3s service is stopped before using `kubectl delete` to remove the node from the Kubernetes and etcd cluster. You should do this one node at a time to ensure that your cluster d
oes not lose quorum. Failure to follow this process may result in K3s on the deleted node crashing, restarting, and rejoining the cluster.

## Changes since v1.23.3+k3s1:

* Updated to V1.23.4 k3s1 and updated traefik to v2.6.1 [(#5135)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5135)

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.23.3, and fixes a small number of issues. Upstream Kubernetes identified [an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/107690) with v1.23.x around custom resources. As such, v1.23.3 is being released sooner than expected. 


For more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1232).

Before upgrading from earlier releases, be sure to read the Kubernetes [Urgent Upgrade Notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#urgent-upgrade-notes).  

## Known Issues: 
* There is [an issue](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4023) that may cause unexpected behavior when removing servers running embedded etcd from the cluster. When removing servers with etcd from the cluster, ensure that the k3s service is stopped before using `kubectl delete` to remove the node from the Kubernetes and etcd cluster. You should do this one node at a time to ensure that your cluster does not lose quorum. Failure to follow this process may result in K3s on the deleted node crashing, restarting, and rejoining the cluster.

## Changes since v1.23.2+k3s1:
* Update to v1.23.3 [(#5027)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5027)
* Move containerd wait into exported function [(#5021)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5021)
* Add Rocket.Chat to list of adopters [(#5017)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5017)

# Release v1.23.1+k3s2
<!-- v1.23.1+k3s2 -->
This release fixes several issues, including an issue with the --agent-token flag that could prevent servers from joining managed etcd clusters when this flag was used.
<!--

# Release v1.23.1+k3s1
<!-- v1.23.1+k3s1 -->
This release is K3s's first in the v1.23 line. It updates Kubernetes to [v1.23.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1220)

As this release includes a number of significant changes from previous versions, we will not make v1.23 available via the [stable release channel](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/upgrades/basic/#release-channels) until v1.23.2+k3s1 or later.

Before upgrading from earlier releases, be sure to read the Kubernetes [Urgent Upgrade Notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#urgent-upgrade-notes).  

## Known Issues: 
* [#4881](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4881): When using embedded etcd and the initial server is started with --agent-token, and this agent-only token does not match the server --token value, additional servers cannot join the cluster. This will be fixed in a subsequent release.
* [#4023](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4023): When removing servers with etcd from the cluster, ensure that the k3s service is stopped before using `kubectl delete` to remove the node from the Kubernetes and etcd cluster. You should do this one node at a time to ensure that your cluster does not lose quorum. Failure to follow this process may result in K3s on the deleted node crashing, restarting, and rejoining the cluster.
* [#4784](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4784): When creating a new cluster, etcd-only servers (if any) must be created before control-plane servers.
