# Release v1.3.19

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Enhancements

- Introduced `v1.24.10-rancher4-1`, `v1.23.16-rancher2-1` and `v1.22.17-rancher1-2`. 

## Major Bug Fixes 
- Fixed high cpu usage issue for v1.24 clusters [#38816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816) 
- Fixed issues around `hostname-override` for AWS cloud provider: 
   1. Added `hostname-override` back to RKE. RKE will continue finding the node by matching `hostname_override` to `kubernetes.io/hostname` label on the node. Fixes `node not found` regression. 
   
   2. RKE will now set the `hostname-override` for `kube-proxy` to the instance metadata hostname only if `useInstanceMetadataHostname` is true. If `useInstanceMetadataHostname` is false, RKE will use `hostname-override` set by users. 
   
   Refer to [RKE PR](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/3136) for more details and https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37634#issuecomment-1404341406 for testing usecases. 

- Fixed upgrade issue from clusters having v1beta1 calico custom resource definitions with latest kubernetes versions. [#40280](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40280)

- Removed flannel cpu/memory limits with latest kubernetes versions [#40178](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40178) 
      
## Known Major Issues
- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g., hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

## Kubernetes Versions

Each version of RKE has a specific list of supported Kubernetes versions. If you want to use a different version than listed below, you will need to update Kubernetes using the [system images](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/system-images/) option in your `cluster.yml`.

# Release v1.3.18

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Enhancements

- Introduced `v1.24.9-rancher1-1` ,`v1.23.15-rancher1-1` and `v1.22.17-rancher1-1`. 
- Introduced canal and calico v3.22.5 for `v1.24.9-rancher1-1` ,`v1.23.15-rancher1-1` and `v1.22.17-rancher1-1`

## Known Major Issues

- Ephemeral `/var/lib/dockershim` and `/var/lib/cri-dockerd` directories for kubelet container could cause kubelet/dockershim to send empty portMappings after upgrade. The workaround is to bind mount these directories by specifying `extra_binds` for kubelet service. See [#2993](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/2993). 
- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g., hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

# Release v1.3.9

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Announcement 
**A data-corruption issue is reported in etcd 3.5.0, 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 per [upstream etcd advisory](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ). [The upstream issue](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766) has not yet been resolved and no fix is available.**
**All 1.22 and 1.23 releases of RKE embed etcd v3.5.x. For this reason, we recommend that users avoid deploying new production Kubernetes clusters using these releases until the issue is fixed upstream and we publish a release that includes that fix.** 

**Please note that RKE v1.3.8+ creates clusters with v1.22.x by default so we recommend setting `kubernetes_version:` in cluster.yml to other available Kubernetes versions.**

**For existing clusters created with these versions, upstream recommends:** 

> Enable data corruption check with `--experimental-initial-corrupt-check` flag. The flag is the only reliable automated way of detecting an inconsistency. This mode has seen significant usage in production and is going to be promoted as default in etcd v3.6. 

Per upstream recommendation as mentioned above, please update your existing clusters to the following new versions introduced with RKE v1.3.9: `v1.22.7-rancher1-2` and `v1.23.4-rancher1-2`. They have the etcd arg `experimental-initial-corrupt-check` set to `true`.  

**Note this may not always work https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766#issuecomment-1083033017 and we suggest not deploying new clusters on production with these versions.** 

## Known Major Issues

- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured, and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g. hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

## Kubernetes Versions

Each version of RKE has a specific list of supported Kubernetes versions. If you want to use a different version than listed below, you will need to update Kubernetes using the [system images](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/system-images/) option in your `cluster.yml`.

# Release v1.3.8

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Enhancements

- Kubernetes v1.22 is no longer experimental and is now supported. Kubernetes v1.23 is experimental.

## Major Bug Fixes

- CoreDNS Autoscaler now has a readiness and liveness check. See [#24939](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/24939).
- Fixed a regression such that options passed in cluster configuration for nginx configuration don't get passed to the new nginx ingress controller configmap. This is fixed with Kubernetes versions `1.19.16-rancher1-4`, `1.20.15-rancher1-2`, `1.21.9-rancher1-2`. See [#36851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36851#issuecomment-1076611079) for more information.
- Fixed an issue where rotateEncryptionKey resulted into a panic when creating cluster. See [#36333](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36333).

## Known Major Issues

- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured, and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g. hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Enhancements

- Introduced `v1.24.10-rancher4-1`, `v1.23.16-rancher2-1` and `v1.22.17-rancher1-2`. 

## Major Bug Fixes 
- Fixed high cpu usage issue for v1.24 clusters [#38816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816) 
- Fixed issues around `hostname-override` for AWS cloud provider: 
   1. Added `hostname-override` back to RKE. RKE will continue finding the node by matching `hostname_override` to `kubernetes.io/hostname` label on the node. Fixes `node not found` regression. 
   
   2. RKE will now set the `hostname-override` for `kube-proxy` to the instance metadata hostname only if `useInstanceMetadataHostname` is true. If `useInstanceMetadataHostname` is false, RKE will use `hostname-override` set by users. 
   
   Refer to [RKE PR](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/3136) for more details and https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37634#issuecomment-1404341406 for testing usecases. 

- Fixed upgrade issue from clusters having v1beta1 calico custom resource definitions with latest kubernetes versions. [#40280](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40280)

- Removed flannel cpu/memory limits with latest kubernetes versions [#40178](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40178) 
      
## Known Major Issues
- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g., hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

# Release v1.3.16

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Enhancements

- Introduced `v1.24.6-rancher1-1` and `v1.23.12-rancher1-1`.  
- Updated `v1.22.15` to use new metrics-server v0.5.2. 

## Known Major Issues

- Ephemeral `/var/lib/dockershim` and `/var/lib/cri-dockerd` directories for kubelet container could cause kubelet/dockershim to send empty portMappings after upgrade. The workaround is to bind mount these directories by specifying `extra_binds` for kubelet service. See [#2993](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/2993). 
- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g., hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

## Kubernetes Versions

Each version of RKE has a specific list of supported Kubernetes versions. If you want to use a different version than listed below, you will need to update Kubernetes using the [system images](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/system-images/) option in your `cluster.yml`.

# Release v1.3.9

With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Announcement 
**A data-corruption issue is reported in etcd 3.5.0, 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 per [upstream etcd advisory](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ). [The upstream issue](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766) has not yet been resolved and no fix is available.**
**All 1.22 and 1.23 releases of RKE embed etcd v3.5.x. For this reason, we recommend that users avoid deploying new production Kubernetes clusters using these releases until the issue is fixed upstream and we publish a release that includes that fix.** 

**Please note that RKE v1.3.8+ creates clusters with v1.22.x by default so we recommend setting `kubernetes_version:` in cluster.yml to other available Kubernetes versions.**

**For existing clusters created with these versions, upstream recommends:** 

> Enable data corruption check with `--experimental-initial-corrupt-check` flag. The flag is the only reliable automated way of detecting an inconsistency. This mode has seen significant usage in production and is going to be promoted as default in etcd v3.6. 

Per upstream recommendation as mentioned above, please update your existing clusters to the following new versions introduced with RKE v1.3.9: `v1.22.7-rancher1-2` and `v1.23.4-rancher1-2`. They have the etcd arg `experimental-initial-corrupt-check` set to `true`.  

**Note this may not always work https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766#issuecomment-1083033017 and we suggest not deploying new clusters on production with these versions.** 

## Known Major Issues

- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured, and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g. hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes is both simplified and easily automated, and it’s entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Enhancements

* Introduced new Kubernetes images `v1.22.5-rancher2`, and `v1.21.8-rancher2` to use new hyperkube base with updated iptables > 1.8.5 https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35709 

## Fixes 

* Added logic to delete hostname-override in kubelet for aws cloud provider https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2803

## Known Major Issues
- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured, and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g. hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. [[#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725)]

## Kubernetes Versions

Each version of RKE has a specific list of supported Kubernetes versions. If you want to use a different version than listed below, you will need to update Kubernetes using the [system images](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/system-images/) option in your `cluster.yml`.
