# Release v1.2.23

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Enhancements

- Introduced `v1.19.16-rancher2-1` with updated hyperkube. See [rancher/38907](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38907)

## Known Major Issues

- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g., hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

## Kubernetes Versions

Each version of RKE has a specific list of supported Kubernetes versions. If you want to use a different version than listed below, you will need to update Kubernetes using the [system images](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/system-images/) option in your `cluster.yml`.

| Kubernetes version    |
| --------------------- |
| `v1.20.15-rancher2-1`  |
| `v1.19.16-rancher2-1` |
| `v1.18.20-rancher1-3` |
| `v1.17.17-rancher2-4` |

## Major Bug Fixes

- Introduced new `v1.20.15-rancher2-1` with new hyperkube image `v1.20.15-rancher2`. See [#37655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37655).

## Known Major Issues

- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g., hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes are both simplified and easily automated, and they are entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running.

## Major Bug Fixes

- Introduced new versions `v1.19.16-rancher1-6` and `v1.20.15-rancher1-4` to use `nginx-1.2.1-rancher1` based off of upstream [nginx ingress v1.2.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v1.2.1). 

## Known Major Issues

## Major Bug Fixes

- Fixed a regression such that options passed in cluster configuration for nginx configuration don't get passed to the new nginx ingress controller configmap. This is fixed with Kubernetes versions `1.19.16-rancher1-4` and `1.20.15-rancher1-2`. See [#36851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36851#issuecomment-1076611079) for more information.
- CoreDNS Autoscaler now has a readiness and liveness check. See [#36362](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36362).
- Ingresses on Amazon EC2 node driver clusters in an HA Rancher cluster on v1.20 may now be created without error. See [#35754](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35754).

## Known Major Issues

- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured, and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g. hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See [#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725).

* Introduced new Kubernetes images `v1.20.6-rancher1-1`, `v1.19.10-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.18-rancher1-2` and `v1.17.17-rancher2-3`
* Kubeconfig and state files have file permissions set to 0600
* The S3 Access Key and Secret Key are passed as environment variables to the etcd-rolling-snapshots container

## Known Major Issues
- In clusters where `cloud_provider` is configured, and either `address` or `internal_address` does not contain a valid IP address (e.g. hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. [[#1725](https://github.com/rancher/rke/issues/1725)]

## Kubernetes Versions

Each version of RKE has a specific list of supported Kubernetes versions. If you want to use a different version than listed below, you will need to update Kubernetes using the [system images](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/system-images/) option in your `cluster.yml`.
